# Key loop feedback and ideas:

- market research - competition apps
- speak to real people for feedback (sam snowden)
- pricing, more detail, factors, compare to phone bill
- additional features?, too simple solution, notifications on phone for important updates (sms etc)
- upsell opportunities (car wash at end of repair etc)
